			<p id="intro"> <b>Have you ever gone through a new website and noticed flaws in the interface? </b>
				<br> Today we will grow through the process of redesigning a website by creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.

			<h2>Website: Yale School of Art</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="text" id="website">
			<img src="yale.jpg" alt="messsy matt persona" width=30% >
			<div class="two_levels">
				<p style="padding-bottom:.5em">The Yale School of Art website is composed of distracting animated backgrounds, inconsistent use of colors, font styles, layout design, and so much more that creates a negative user experience.</p>
				<p><b>Link: </b><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/apply" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a></p>
				<p>I recognize the fact that this is a colaborative experiment where those with a Yale ID can edit the webpage. I am disregarding that aspect and focusing solely on the design and usability of the website itself.</p>

			<h2>Usability & Accessibility Problems</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="text"> 
			<p>The following are notes on the usability and accessbility issues with this interface.
				<br><br><b>Usability:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">It is a completely overwhelming interface.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">There is no consistent style or color palette.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">There is no hierarchy; there's a need to look everywhere to locate something or to make sure nothing important is missed.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The website almost feels fake and untrustworthy due to the design. At first site, someone might have thought they clicked on the wrong link in order to get to the Yale School of Art.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The purpose of this site is to apply to the school, however the link to start an application is not clear.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em"><u>Learnability:</u> Because it is very distracting, it forces users to get familiar with the whole interface.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em"><u>Memorability:</u> Several different styles and colors is hard to remember, especially for casual users.</li></li> 
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em"><u>Efficiency:</u> It is a very unique looking website, so a frequent user might get used to looking at distinct aspects of the website to locate where they need to go.</li></li> 
				</ul>
				<b>Accessibility:</b>
				<ul>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">After running it through the WAVE tool to check for accessibility problems, no errors or contrast errors appeared. However, I completely disagree. </li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Some of the text, including the address at the top and the contact options below, is too small to read.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The highlighting behind the text can make it difficult to read as well, especially since there is no padding around the words.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Some of the background colors and text colors do not work well with one another, providing a poor contrast for users with visual impairments.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">As for a user who needs to navigate via keyboard or audio, there are some alerts with missing heading levels or skipped headings to could potentially cause issues.</li> 
				</ul>

			<h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
		</div>
			
		<div class="text lowfi">
			<br>
			<img src="Desktop_L.jpg" alt="lowfi wireframing for desktop" width=30% >
				<ol> <b>Desktop Version:</b>
					<br>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Clean organization with the boxes of information to provide an intuitive flow of information.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Clear hierarchy with different color boxes to help the user identify regular information compared to urgent information such as important dates.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">A button that is easily identifiable so the user knows exactly where to start the application process.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Information such as the address and extra links to contact the school is consolidated in the footer for extra organization and easy access.</li>

				<ol> <b>Notes on Redesign:</b>
					<br>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The main information, application information, and important dates boxes utilize flex to allow the sections to reorder when the screen is made smaller.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">When you hover over the options in the navigation bar, they will change a different color to signal the user that it is clickable.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The “Apply Here” buttons, the buttons in the “More Information” section, and the links in the footer will make your cursor change into a pointer when you hover over it.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">All the text remains relatively the same size, with some slight movement from the sections and the buttons when the screen size is adjusted.</li>
				</ol>
