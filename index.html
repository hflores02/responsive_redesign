			<h2>What is UX Design?</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="text"> 
			<p id="intro"> UX (user experience) Design is the process of planing the experience an individal has when they interact with a product. It focuses on the interaction that a human being has with everyday servics and products. The main objecive of UX design is to make using these servics and products, both physical and digital, simple, intuitive, and enjoyable. [1]
				<br><br>Developing personas through observations and interviews and then creating a stroyboard are some techniques designers us to understand their user’s experience with a product:
			</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Persona:</th>
					<td>a fictional character that represents a typical user of an app, website, or other product. A user persona helps clarify your target audience: It helps with design iteration. [2]</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr> </tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Storyboard:</th>
					<td>a tool that visually predicts and explores a user's experience with a product. It presents a product very much like a movie in terms of how people will use it. [3]</td> 
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p id="single"><b>Now let's go through the process of developing personas and a storyboard for an example interface!</b></p>

			<h2>Interface: Washing Machine</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="text">
			<p><b>Description:</b><br> A washing machine cleans clothing by agitating the clothes in soap and water to remove dirt and stains before spinning to drain the water after the cycle has finished. The main components of the machine include the <u>drum</u>, the <u>detergent drawer</u>, and the <u>control panel</u>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The drum is where the clothes are placed to be washed.</li>
				<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The detergent drawer is where various liquids can be placed such as laundry detergent, softener, and bleach.</li>
				<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">The control panel contains the setting options for the specific load. This includes the type of wash, cycle, and temperature of water.</li>
				</li> 
			</ul>

			<p>Interviews were conducted via a google form:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3UefU3vb48-EfITSzBAIn8Q1tJbWfpYWN_rhF2xorMv3qow/viewform" target="_blank">Google Form Survey!</a></p>

			<h2>Observations & Survey Results</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="text"> 
			<p>The following notes were taken after observing a few individuals do their laundry one weekend.
				<br><br><b>Observation Notes:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Everyone used detergent pods; 2 out of the 3 people would put it in the drum before placing their laundry inside, which is the proper way to use them.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">After closing the drum door, there was always an initial pause while staring at the control panel. After a couple of seconds of waving their hand over the panel, they would select their options and wait for the machine to start.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Some individuals were rushing, resulting in them dropping laundry while placing it inside; some were even pressing random buttons on the control panel before settling for the last options.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">After the wash started and they saw the minutes appear on the screen, they proceeded to leave the laundry room without setting a timer on. Some people had their phones and set their timer on right away.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">I noticed several washers had finished loads placed on top due to people not being there right when their laundry finished and others removing the clothing to use the machine.
					</li>

			<p><b>Survey Results Summary:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">All respondents said that their motivation for doing laundry is waiting until they are essentially wearing their last articles of clothing.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">A majority of respondents stated that they will set a timer on to know when their load is done, while some say they just have a feeling when its done and go by that. Doing homework while the load was running was the common response.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">A majority of respondents agreed that the settings options are perfect and there are just the right amount. However, some say that there could be different settings and that there are definitely not enough options.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">All respondents use detergent pods, which allows them to directly throw it inside the drum of the machine instead of having to use the detergent drawer.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom:.5em">Most respondents expressed that they are doing laundry at ungodly hours, some in the afternoon.  This ranges from a weekly task to doing it every 2-3 weeks.</li>

			<h2>Personas</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="text" id="single">
			<p> <b>Data has been collected through surveys and observations; now it is time to create personas. The personas are based on overarching trends observed amongst all the users that were interviewed, not characteristics from one individual.</b></p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="text" id="persona1">
			<img src="messymatt.jpg" alt="messsy matt persona" width=30% >
			<p>Messy Matt is not receiving assistance from the machine about the steps he should take to wash his load and he’s not quite sure what some of the setting options mean. The most common motivation for doing laundry was the lack of clean clothing the individual had. Some were evidently more in a rush to get their clothes washed, resulting in forgetting to place the detergent pod in the drum and looking overwhelmed when checking the settings, as seen with Messy Matt.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="text" id="persona1">	
			<img src="cleanclaire.jpg" alt="messsy matt persona" width=30% >
			<p>Clean Claire is frustrated with the limited setting options offered by the washing machine. She also falls victim to not keeping track of the time for her wash, something that can be implemented as a text reminder or software app with the washing machine, and ends up having her laundry being taken out of the wash. While many will say they set a time or will merely remember, many will not remember or come down at the time their wash is complete. This is a great example of how someone will say something and do the opposite.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard</h2>

		<div class="text" id="single">
			<p> <b>Storyboarding is the final step. This is where we illustrate a persona's user journey from start to end. <br>The storyboard reflects the goals of the persona and include all steps taken for using the interface.</b></p>
